# Code Style & Conventions

## TypeScript

- Strict mode enabled
- No `any` type (anti-pattern per project rules)
- ESNext target
- JSX with React

## Principles

- **KISS** — Keep It Simple, Stupid
- **DRY** — Don't Repeat Yourself
- **SSOT** — Single Source of Truth (when truths diverge)

## Naming

- PascalCase for components and types
- camelCase for functions and variables
- kebab-case for file names (when not components)

## Comments

- Avoid obvious/useless comments
- Document only non-self-evident logic
